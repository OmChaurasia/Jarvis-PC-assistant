# JARVIS : PC Assistant

## How it works

- For UI design to recieve the command I used `flask` server
- The flask server is running on localhost that means we can use this with phone with computer's IP
- We are taking command using a simple `html` form and handleing requests using flask
- According to command we are providing the instruction to PC and return a template with output voice
